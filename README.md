# Conditional_statements

"üöÄ Just wrapped up solving a diverse set of problems centered around conditional statements in programming! Here's a quick overview of the topics I covered:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Simple if statements: Utilized to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Else if statements: Employed when multiple conditions need to be checked, and the first condition evaluates to false.

3Ô∏è‚É£ If-elif statements: Combined if and elif (else if) statements to handle multiple conditions and execute the corresponding code block.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Nested if statements: Employed when an if statement is nested within another if statement, allowing for complex conditional branching.
